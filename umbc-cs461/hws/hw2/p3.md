Exercises 3.11 and 3.12 (20 pts) from the DSC textbook

### Exercise 3.11

Write the following queries in SQL, using the university schema.

#### a.

Find the names of all students who have taken at least one Comp. Sci. course; 
make sure there are no duplicate names in the result.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT student.name FROM student
NATURAL JOIN takes
NATURAL JOIN course
WHERE course.dept_name = "Comp. Sci.";
```

#### b.

Find the IDs and names of all students who have not taken any course offering 
before Spring 2009.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT student.ID, student.name FROM student
NATURAL JOIN takes
NATURAL JOIN section
WHERE NOT(section.year < 2009);
```

#### c. 

For each department, find the maximum salary of instructors in that department. 
You may assume that every department has at least one instructor.

```sql
SELECT dept_name, max(salary) FROM instructor
GROUP BY dept_name;
```

#### d. 

Find the lowest, across all departments, of the per-department maximum salary 
computed by the preceding query.

```sql
SELECT min(max_salary) FROM (
    SELECT dept_name, max(salary) AS max_salary 
    FROM instructor
    GROUP BY dept_name
);
```

### Exercise 3.12

Write the following queries in SQL, using the university schema.


#### a.

Create a new course "CS-001", titled "Weekly Seminar", with 0 credits.

```sql
INSERT INTO course (course_id, title, dept_name, credits)
VALUES ("CS-001", "Weekly Seminar", "Comp. Sci.", 0);
```

#### b.

Create a section of this course in Autumn 2009, with `sec_id` of 1.

```sql
INSERT INTO section (course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
VALUES ("CS-001", 1, "Fall", 2009);
```

#### c.

Enroll every student in the Comp. Sci. department in the above section.

```sql
INSERT INTO takes (ID, course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
SELECT ID, "CS-001", 1, "Fall", 2009 FROM student
WHERE dept_name = "Comp. Sci.";
```

#### d.

Delete enrollments in the above section where the studentâ€™s name is Chavez.

```sql
DELETE FROM takes 
WHERE (takes.course_id = "CS-001") 
AND (takes.sec_id = 1)
AND (takes.semester = "Fall")
AND (takes.year = 2009)
AND (takes.ID in (
        SELECT ID FROM student 
        WHERE name = "Chavez" 
    ));
```

#### e.

Delete the course CS-001. What will happen if you run this delete statement 
without first deleting offerings (sections) of this course.

```sql
DELETE FROM course WHERE course_id = "CS-001";
```

Deletes are set to cascade from course, so it will cascade delete all the entries
including it in section from the database.

#### f.

Delete all `takes` tuples corresponding to any section of any course with the
word "database" as a part of the title; ignore case when matching the word with 
the title.

```sql
DELETE FROM takes WHERE course_Id in (
	SELECT course_id FROM courses WHERE lower(title) like "%database%"
);
```
