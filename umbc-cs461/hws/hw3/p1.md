## Problem 1

Exercise 4.1 from the DSC textbook

### Exercise 4.1

Write the following queries in SQL , using the university schema.

All of these queries were followed by the query `USE university;` I didn't include
it in each snippet because it would've been redundant.

#### a. 

Display a list of all instructors, showing their ID, name, and the number of sections 
that they have taught. Make sure to show the number of sections as 0 for instructors 
who have not taught any section. Your query should use an outerjoin, and should not 
use scalar subqueries.

```sql

```

#### b. 

Write the same query as above, but using a scalar subquery, without outerjoin.

```sql

```

#### c.

Display the list of all course sections offered in Spring 2010, along with the names 
of the instructors teaching the section. If a section has more than one instructor, 
it should appear as many times in the resultas it has instructors. If it does not have 
any instructor, it should stillappear in the result with the instructor name set to "â€”".

```sql


```

#### d.

Display the list of all departments, with the total number of instructors in each 
department, without using scalar subqueries. Make sure tocorrectly handle departments 
with no instructors.

```sql

```
