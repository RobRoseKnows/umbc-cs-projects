## Problem 1

Exercise 4.16 from the DSC textbook

### Exercise 4.16

Referential-integrity constraints as defined in this chapter involve exactly two

#### a. 

Propose a syntax for expressing such constraints.

```sql

```

#### b. 

Discuss the actions that the system must take to enforce a constraintof this form.

```sql
