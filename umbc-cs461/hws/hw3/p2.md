## Problem 2

Exercise 4.5 and 4.13 from the DSC textbook

### Exercise 4.5

Show how to define the view `student_grades(ID, GPA)` giving the grade-point average 
of each student, based on the query in Exercise 3.2; recallthat we used a relation 
`grade_points(grade,points)` to get the numeric points associated with a letter grade. 
Make sure your view definition correctly handles the case of `null` values for the grade
attribute of the `takes` relation.

### Exercise 4.13

Under what circumstances would the query

```sql
select * 
from student natural full outer join takes natural full outer join course;
```

include tuples with null values for the `title` attribute?
