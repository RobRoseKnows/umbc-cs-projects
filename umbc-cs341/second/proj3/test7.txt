First a small test...

 Node report on position LLRR :
   key = 17   height = 0   size = 1
   no left child
   no right child

 Node report on position LLR :
   key = 15   height = 1   size = 2
   no left child
   right child key = 17

 Node report on position LL :
   key = 14   height = 2   size = 3
   no left child
   right child key = 15

 Node report on position LRL :
   key = 20   height = 0   size = 1
   no left child
   no right child

 Node report on position LRR :
   key = 31   height = 0   size = 1
   no left child
   no right child

 Node report on position LR :
   key = 30   height = 1   size = 3
   left child key = 20
   right child key = 31

 Node report on position L :
   key = 19   height = 3   size = 7
   left child key = 14
   right child key = 30

 Node report on position RLL :
   key = 33   height = 0   size = 1
   no left child
   no right child

 Node report on position RLR :
   key = 38   height = 0   size = 1
   no left child
   no right child

 Node report on position RL :
   key = 34   height = 1   size = 3
   left child key = 33
   right child key = 38

 Node report on position RRLR :
   key = 43   height = 0   size = 1
   no left child
   no right child

 Node report on position RRL :
   key = 41   height = 1   size = 2
   no left child
   right child key = 43

 Node report on position RRRLR :
   key = 95   height = 0   size = 1
   no left child
   no right child

 Node report on position RRRL :
   key = 81   height = 1   size = 2
   no left child
   right child key = 95

 Node report on position RRR :
   key = 110   height = 2   size = 3
   left child key = 81
   no right child

 Node report on position RR :
   key = 70   height = 3   size = 6
   left child key = 41
   right child key = 110

 Node report on position R :
   key = 40   height = 4   size = 10
   left child key = 34
   right child key = 70

 Node report on position  :
   key = 32   height = 5   size = 18
   left child key = 19
   right child key = 40


Small tree has root with key=32, height=5, size=18


Now a big test...


Big tree has root with key=2869, height=15, size=5050
