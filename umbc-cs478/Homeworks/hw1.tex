\begin{enumerate}
\item For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally
      expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to better
      better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The sample size $n$ is extremely large, and the number of predictors
        $p$ is small.\\
  \vspace{-2.5em}
  \paragraph{True/False} Answer

  \item The number of predictors $p$ is extremely large, and the number of
        observations $n$ is small.\\
  \vspace{-2.5em}
  \paragraph{True/False} Answer

  \item The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.\\
  \vspace{-2.5em}
  \paragraph{True/False} Answer

  \item The variance of the error terms, i.e. $\sigma^2 = Var(\epsilon)$, is extremely high.\\
  \vspace{-2.5em}
  \paragraph{True/False} Answer
  \end{enumerate}
\newpage

\item Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem,
      and indicate whether we are most interested in inference or prediction.
      Finally, provide $n$ and $p$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each firm
        we record profit, number of employees, industry and the CEO salary. We
        are interested in understanding which factors affect CEO salary.\\
  \vspace{-2.5em}
  \paragraph{Regression} We're trying to model a number (CEO salary) rather than
        assign a single label. $n = 500, p = 4$

  \item We are considering launching a new product and wish to know whether it
        will be a \textif{success} or a \textif{failure}. We collect data on 20
        similar products that were previously launched. For each product we have
        recorded whether it was a success or failure, price charged for the product,
        marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables.\\

  \paragraph{Classification/Regression} Answer

  \item We are interested in predicting the \% change in the USD/Euro exchange rate
        in relation to the weekly changes in the world stock markets. Hence we collect
        weekly data for all of 2012. For each week we record the \% change in the
        USD/Euro, the \% change in the US market, the \% change in the British market,
        and the \% change in the German market.\\
