## Part 1: Install Hadoop

For this homework, I was originally going to try to install Hadoop in a Docker 
container so that I wouldn't clutter my computer with an install that I didn't
plan on using again. However, that turned out to be harder than expected, so
I just installed it the normal way as a standalone operation.

Since I'm running Ubuntu, setting up was fairly easy. I just downloaded one of
the recent binary distributions and installed Java, then I executed Hadoop to do
part 2, the mapreduce tutorial.

## Part 2: MapReduce Tutorial

I completed the MapReduce tutorial without any trouble. I used the source code provided
in the tutorial to complete it.
