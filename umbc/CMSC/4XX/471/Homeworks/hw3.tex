  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Draw the portion of the state space for states 1 to 15.

  \item Suppose the goal state is 11. List the order in which nodes will be visited for breadth-first search, depth-limited search with limit 3, and iterative deepening search.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Breadth-First Search}: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, \textbf{11}
  \item \textbf{Depth-Limited Search}: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 10, \textbf{11}
  \item \textbf{Iterative Deepening Search}: \{1\}, \{1, 2, 3\}, \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}, \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, \textbf{11}\}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item How well would bidirectional search work on this problem? What is the branching factor in each direction of the bidirectional search?\\
  \vspace{-2.5em}
  \paragraph{Well.} It would work rather well as there is a sole starting and final state and there is only one path between them. Branching factor would be 2.
  \item Does the answer to (c) suggest a reformulation of the problem that would allow you to solve the problem of getting from state 1 to a given goal state with almost no search?\\
  \vspace{-2.5em}
  \paragraph{Yes} This is effectively a binary search tree so we could just keep going to whatever branch has a higher state less than 11.
  \item Call the action going from $k$ to $2k$ Left, and the action from going to $2k + 1$ Right. Can you find an algorithm that outputs the solution to this problem without any search at all?\\
  \vspace{-2.5em}
  \paragraph{Yes} The path between 1 and 11 will be Left, Right, Right.
  \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{3.26} Consider the unbounded version of the regular 2D grid shown in Figure 3.9. The start state is at the origin, (0,0), and the goal state is at ($x$, $y$).
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the branching factor $b$ in this state space?
  \item How many distinct states are there at depth $k$ (for $k > 0$)?
  \item What is the maximum number of nodes expanded by breadth-first tree search?
  \item What is the maximum number of nodes expanded by breadth-first graph search?
  \item Is $h = \left|u - x\right| + \left|v - y\right|$ an admissible heuristic for a state at ($u, v$)? Explain.
  \item How many nodes are expanded by A* graph search using $h$?
  \item Does $h$ remain admissible if some links are removed?
  \item Does $h$ remain admissible if some links are added between nonadjacent states?
