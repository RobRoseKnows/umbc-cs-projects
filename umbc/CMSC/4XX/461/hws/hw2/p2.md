Exercises 3.4 and 3.14 (10 pts) from the DSC textbook

### Exercise 3.4

Consider the insurance database of Figure 3.18, where the primary keys are 
underlined. Construct the following SQL queries for this relational database.

#### a.

Find the total number of people who owned cars that were involved in accidents 
in 2009.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(driver_id) FROM participated
NATURAL JOIN accident
WHERE YEAR(`date`) = 2009;
```

#### b.

Add a new accident to the database; assume any values for required attributes.

```sql
-- Assuming primary key of report_number is set to auto-increment
INSERT INTO accident (date, location)
VALUES ('2019-01-01', 'Road Road');
```

#### c. 

Delete the Mazda belonging to "John Smith".

```sql
DELETE FROM car
WHERE model = 'Mazda'
AND car.license = owns.license
AND owns.driver_id = person.driver_id
AND person.name = 'John Smith';
```


### Exercise 3.14

Consider the insurance database of Figure 3.18, where the primary keys are 
underlined. Construct the following SQL queries for this relational database.

#### a.

involved.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(report_number) FROM participated
NATURAL JOIN person
WHERE person.name LIKE "John Smith";
```

#### b.

Update the damage amount for the car with the license number "AABB2000" in the 
accident with report number "AR2197" to $3000.
