### Exercise 7.21

Design a database for an automobile company to provide to its dealers to assist 
them in maintaining customer records and dealer inventory and to assist sales 
staff in ordering cars. Each vehicle is identified by a vehicle identification 
number (VIN). Each individual vehicle is a particular model of a particular brand 
offered by thecompany (e.g., theXFis a model of the car brand Jaguar of Tata Motors).
Each model can be offered with a variety of options, but an individual car may 
have only some (or none) of the available options. The database needs to store 
information about models, brands, and options, as well asinformation about individual 
dealers, customers, and cars.Your design should include an E-R diagram, a set of 
relational schemas,and a list of constraints, including primary-key and foreign-key 
constraints.

#### Entity Relationship Diagram

#### Schemas

Primary Keys are in bold.

vehicles(__vin__, sold, year, make, model)  
cars(__make__, __model__, msrp)  
options(__make__, __model__, __option__, msrp, description)  
has_options(__make__, __model__, __option__, __vin__)
dealer(__id__, city, state, name)
customer(__id__, city, state, name, gender)
buys(__id__, __vin__, price)
sells(__id__, __vin__, price)

#### Constraints

- Primary keys are in bold in schema.
- ForeignKeys
  - vehicles(make, model) -> cars(make, model)
  - options(make, model) -> cars(make, model)
  - has_options(make, model, option) -> options(make, model, option)
  - has_options(vin) -> vehicles(vin)
  - buys(id) -> dealer(id)
  - buys(vin) -> vehicles(vin)
  - sells(id) -> customer(id)
  - sells(vin) -> vehicles(vin)
