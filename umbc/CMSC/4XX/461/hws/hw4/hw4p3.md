Exercises 11.6 and 11.7

### Exercise 11.6

Suppose that we are using extendable hashing on a file that contains
records with the following search-key values:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31

Show the extendable hash structure for this file if the hash function is
h(x) = x mod 8 and buckets can hold three records.

### Exercise 11.7

Show how the extendable hash structure of Practice Exercise 11.6 changes
as the result of each of the following steps:

#### a. Delete 11.

#### b. Delete 31.

#### c. Insert 1.

#### d. Insert 15.
