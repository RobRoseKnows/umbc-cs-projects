\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{2.5.71} An oil exploration company currently has two active projects, one in Asia and the other in Europe. Let $A$ be the even that the Asian project is successful and $B$ be the event that the European project is successful. Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are independent events with $P(A) = .4$ and $P(B) = .7$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If the Asian project is not successful, what is the probability that the European project is also not successful? Explain your reasoning.
  \item What is the probability that at least one of the two projects will be successful?
  \item Given that at least one of the two projects is successful, what is the probability that only the Asian project is successful?
  \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{2.5.87} Consider randomly selecting a single individual and having that person test drive 3 different vehicles. Define events A\textsubscript{1}, A\textsubscript{2}, and A\textsubscript{3} by
\begin{align*}
&A_1 = \text{likes vehicle \#1} & A_2 = \text{likes vehicle \#2}\\
&A_3 = \text{likes vehicle \#3} &
\end{align*}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the branching factor $b$ in this state space?
  \item How many distinct states are there at depth $k$ (for $k > 0$)?
  \item What is the maximum number of nodes expanded by breadth-first tree search?
  \item What is the maximum number of nodes expanded by breadth-first graph search?
  \item Is $h = \left|u - x\right| + \left|v - y\right|$ an admissible heuristic for a state at ($u, v$)? Explain.
  \item How many nodes are expanded by A* graph search using $h$?
  \item Does $h$ remain admissible if some links are removed?
  \item Does $h$ remain admissible if some links are added between nonadjacent states?
  \end{enumerate}

\newpage

\item \textbf{3.1.5} Consider the unbounded version of the regular 2D grid shown in Figure 3.9. The start state is at the origin, (0,0), and the goal state is at ($x$, $y$).
